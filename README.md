This repository is the tidy data project for class "Getting and Cleaning Data" on Coursera.
The run_analysis.R file will give you the tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. The following we are going to describe how the script works. First of all, I read the data into R in line 1~5 and line 12~14 using the original file name. 













and can be run as long as the Samsung data is in your working directory.
A code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data called CodeBook.md.
